Scenarios:

Tourguide / Cityguide app:

The Client would like an app that provides information about a particular city 
or location. The Consumers are people or groups that are not locals of that 
city or location. The app should provide up to date current information, for
instance Theater schedules, public transportation schedules are prices, Concert
schedules, current museum or gallery exhibitions. But the app should not incure 
( cause ) high data roaming costs. All the information should be viewable offline
after a one time download. 

The Client requires a simple web interface that enables updating data as well 
modifiying and extending the navigation structure of the app.
